Contributing
============

Let's head north, welcome to Septentrion!

This contributing guide is trying to avoid common pitfalls, but the project
development environment is quite common. If it's not your first rodeo, here's a TL;DR

TL;DR
-----

(The following is not meant to be executed as a script)

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Export libpq env vars for PG connection
    $ export PGDATABASE=septentrion PGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password

    $ # Launch PostgreSQL within Docker
    $ compose up -d

    $ # Explore tox entrypoints
    $ tox -l

    $ # You can do things without tox too:

    $ # Install requirements
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    $ # Launch tests
    $ pytest

    $ # Launch demo
    $ septentrion -h

Instructions for contribution
-----------------------------

Environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `export` command below will be necessary whenever you want to interact with
the database (using the project locally, launching tests, ...).
These are standard ``libpq`` environment variables, and the values used below correspond
to the docker setup. Feel free to adjust them as necessary.

.. code-block:: console

    $ export PGDATABASE=septentrion PGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres PGPASSWORD=password

Create your development database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development database can be launched using docker with a single command.
The PostgreSQL database we used is a fresh standard out-of-the-box database
on the latest stable version.

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose up -d

If you want to try out the project locally, it's useful to have ``postgresql-client``
installed. It will give you both a PostgreSQL console (``psql``) and specialized
commands like ``createdb`` we use below.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install postgresql-client
    $ createdb

Set up your development environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't plan to run the code interactively and just want to run tests,
linting and build the doc, you'll just need ``tox``. You can install it
for your user:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --user tox

In order for this to work, you'll need to make sure your python user install binary
directory is included in your shell's ``PATH``. One way of doing that is to add
a line in your ``~/.profile`` (or ``~/.zprofile`` for ``zsh``). The following command
will output the line to write in that file:

.. code-block:: console

    echo 'PATH=$(python3 -c "import site; print(site.USER_BASE)")/bin:$PATH'

If you plan to launch the project locally, install the package itself with development
dependencies in a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate

You can check that your Python environment is properly activated:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv) $ which python
    /path/to/current/folder/.venv/bin/python

Install local dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the project automated tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With a running database:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv) $ pytest  # Test the code with the current interpreter

Or

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox  # Run all the checks for all the interpreters

If you're not familiar with Pytest_, do yourself a treat and look into this fabulous
tool.

.. _Pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

If you don't know Tox_, have a look at their documentation, it's a very nice tool too.

.. _Tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To look at coverage in the browser after launching the tests, use:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m webbrowser htmlcov/index.html

Keep your code clean
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before committing:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e format

If you've committed already, you can do a "Oops lint" commit, but the best is to run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git rebase -i --exec 'tox -e format' origin/master

This will run all code formatters on each commits, so that they're clean.
If you've never done an `interactive rebase`_ before, it may seem complicated, so you
don't have to, but... Learn it, it's really cool !

.. _`interactive rebase`: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History

You can also install a ``pre-commit`` hook which makes sure that all your commits are
created clean:

.. code-block:: console

    cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit <<EOF
    #!/bin/bash -e
    exec ./pre-commit-hook
    EOF
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

If ``tox`` is installed inside your ``virtualenv``, you may want to activate the
``virtualenv`` in ``.git/hooks/pre-commit``:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash -e
    source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
    exec ./pre-commit-hook

This will keep you from creating a commit if there's a linting problem.

Build the documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Without spell checking:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e docs
    $ python -m webbrowser docs/_build/html/index.html

Run spell checking on the documentation:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install enchant
    $ tox -e docs-spelling

Because of outdated software and version incompatibilities, spell checking is not
checked in the CI, and we don't require people to run it in their PR. Though, it's
always a nice thing to do. Feel free to include any spell fix in your PR, even if it's
not related to your PR (but please put it in a dedicated commit).

If you need to add words to the spell checking dictionary, it's in
``docs/spelling_wordlist.txt``. Make sure the file is alphabetically sorted!

With a running database:

.. code-block:: console

    (venv) $ export PGDATABASE=septentrion PGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres
    (venv) $ createdb
    (venv) $ export SEPTENTRION_MIGRATIONS_ROOT=example_migrations SEPTENTRION_TARGET_VERSION=1.1
    (venv) $ septentrion migrate
