# West

> `django-north` without Django

## Overview

[Django-North](https://github.com/peopledoc/django-north) is a tool to manage migrations in Django, without using the core Django migrations.

`west` is a attempt to implement the same mechanics, without having a Django project.

## Requirements

This project would only work for Postgresql databases 9.6+.  
We aim to be compatible with Python 2.7+ and Python 3+.

## Install

at the moment, there's no proper release on PyPI. As a consequence, you'll have to clone this repository locally and install it via:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## What does it do?

Nothing very fancy at the moment. Stay tuned!
